Get physically and mentally exhausted for your final? Why not try this game! "Whack a Mole" is a physical game on the web developed with PoseNet. We see people are spending a lot of time on their screen and in the shop but didn't get a chance to exercise. So we created this game to get people to move in front of the screen, or simply just get away from your work for a little while and exercise in a fun way.
